To compile my smallsh.c code, make sure smallsh.c and the included makefile are in the same directory
on os1. You can then simply type "make" and hit enter, and the makefile commands will get the code compiled
for you. You can then just type "make clean" and hit enter to remove the executable smallsh file after 
compiling if desired. Alternatively, you can compile the smallsh.c file by putting the file in some directory on 
os1 and then typing "gcc -std=c99 -Wall -g -o smallsh smallsh.c" and hitting enter, as those are the exact same
compiling instructions as are present in the makefile. After compiling, the smallsh executable can be used with
the p3testscript file to test my program. Note: p3testscript file not included per the assignment instructions.
